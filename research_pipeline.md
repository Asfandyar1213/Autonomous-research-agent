# Research Pipeline

## Step-by-Step Process from Query to Final Report

### 1. Query Processing and Refinement
- **Input**: Raw research question from user
- **Process**:
  1. Parse the research question using NLP techniques
  2. Extract key concepts, entities, and relationships
  3. Identify domain-specific terminology
  4. Expand query with relevant synonyms and related terms
  5. Generate search queries optimized for each academic API
- **Output**: Structured query object with search parameters for each data source

### 2. Data Acquisition
- **Input**: Structured query object
- **Process**:
  1. Determine optimal order of API calls based on query type
  2. Execute parallel API requests with rate limiting
  3. Cache responses to avoid duplicate requests
  4. Validate and filter initial results for relevance
  5. Retrieve full metadata for most relevant papers
  6. Download full text when available (PDFs, XMLs)
- **Output**: Collection of papers with metadata and content

### 3. Content Processing
- **Input**: Collection of papers with metadata and content
- **Process**:
  1. Extract text from PDFs and other formats
  2. Clean and normalize text (remove formatting artifacts)
  3. Structure content into sections (abstract, introduction, methodology, results, etc.)
  4. Extract figures, tables, and equations with context
  5. Build citation network and identify key references
  6. Create metadata index for efficient retrieval
- **Output**: Structured paper objects with processed content

### 4. Analysis
- **Input**: Structured paper objects
- **Process**:
  1. Apply NLP pipeline for linguistic analysis
  2. Identify research methodologies using classification models
  3. Extract key findings and conclusions
  4. Perform topic modeling to group related papers
  5. Generate semantic embeddings for comparative analysis
  6. Compare methodologies across papers
  7. Identify consensus and contradictions in findings
  8. Evaluate strength of evidence and research quality
- **Output**: Analysis results with extracted insights

### 5. Report Generation
- **Input**: Analysis results
- **Process**:
  1. Select appropriate report template based on query type
  2. Structure content hierarchically
  3. Generate executive summary
  4. Compile methodology comparison section
  5. Synthesize findings across papers
  6. Create visualizations (citation networks, methodology comparisons)
  7. Format citations according to academic standards
  8. Generate bibliography
  9. Perform quality checks (completeness, coherence, accuracy)
- **Output**: Draft research report

### 6. Quality Assurance
- **Input**: Draft research report
- **Process**:
  1. Verify all citations are properly formatted
  2. Check for logical consistency in comparisons
  3. Validate that all sections of the report are complete
  4. Ensure all claims are supported by referenced papers
  5. Check for potential model hallucinations or inaccuracies
  6. Verify that the report directly addresses the original query
- **Output**: Validated research report

### 7. Finalization and Delivery
- **Input**: Validated research report
- **Process**:
  1. Format report according to user preferences
  2. Generate final PDF/HTML/Markdown output
  3. Create machine-readable metadata
  4. Log all processing steps for transparency
  5. Record any limitations or caveats
- **Output**: Final research report with metadata

## Handling Edge Cases

### Insufficient Data
1. Broaden search terms incrementally
2. Explore adjacent research domains
3. Include older publications if recent ones are scarce
4. Clearly indicate data limitations in the report

### Contradictory Findings
1. Group contradicting papers by methodology
2. Analyze potential reasons for contradictions
3. Present balanced view of competing perspectives
4. Indicate strength of evidence for each position

### Highly Technical Content
1. Utilize domain-specific models when available
2. Preserve technical terminology in summaries
3. Provide glossary for specialized terms
4. Maintain mathematical notations accurately

### Interdisciplinary Research
1. Identify primary and secondary domains
2. Apply domain-specific analysis to respective sections
3. Create cross-domain mappings for terminology
4. Highlight interdisciplinary connections and insights
